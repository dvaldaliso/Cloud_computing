/* NAME
 *   mandel - make a plot the Mandelbrot set
 * NOTES
 *   The autoscaling features of the plot library are not used because
 *   there is a slim chance of round-off problems resulting in a
 *   skipped line.
 * MISCELLANY
 *   The method for choosing the viewable region may seem
 *   counter-intuitive at first, but it has some nice properties.  In
 *   particular, selecting the exact (x, y) coordinates for the
 *   upper-left corner and only selecting the lower right y coordinate
 *   forces both the x and y scales to be identical since all scales
 *   are uniquely determined by these values along with the plot
 *   width and height.  If you then change the width or height of the
 *   plot, the relative scales will still match up.
 * BUGS
 *   No sanity checks are performed to make sure that any of the
 *   options make sense.  In particular, the bounding corners can be
 *   screwed up, and division by zero can occur with a malicious
 *   setting of IDIV.

The Mandelbrot set is drawn according to the specified parameters.  The  \

+ c, where c is the complex point (x + yi) that corresponds to an (x, \
y) screen coordinate and the initial value of z(0) = 0.  If the system \
diverges at time k (i.e., |z(k)| > BAIL) then a point at (x, y) is \
plotted with the grayscale color (k / IDIV + (k % IDIV) * (LEVELS / \
IDIV)) % LEVELS), which reduces to (k % LEVELS) with an IDIV of 1. \
